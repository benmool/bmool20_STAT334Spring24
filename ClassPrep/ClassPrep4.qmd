Read Sections 1.3 - 1.7 of Kearen Healy’s Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction, found here. As you read, answer the following questions in just 1 to 2 sentences.

1. What is the difference between a colour’s hue and a colour’s intensity?

A color's hue is the main color that we see, going by the common names of color that we know. The intensity of a color is how vivid the color is, and I interpreted it almost as meaning the "brightness" of the color.

2. Think of an example where you would want to use a sequential colour scale that’s different from the one given in the text. Then, think of examples where you would use a diverging colour scale and an unordered colour scale.

An example that you would want to use a sequential color scale different from one in the text would be when measuring rainfall.

You could use a diverging color scale when measuring thoughts on the current food options on campus, and an unordered color scale when comparing quantitative data between different departments on campus.

3. Some gestalt inferences take priority over others. Using Figure 1.21, give an example of a gestalt inference that takes priority over another one.



4. “Bar charts are better than Pie charts for visualizing a single categorical variable.” Explain how results shown in Figure 1.23 support this claim.



5. Suppose you have a scatterplot of height on the y-axis vs. weight on the x-axis for people born in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. You now want to explore whether the relationship is different for people born in the United States, people born in Canada, and people born in Mexico. Should you use different shapes to distinguish the three countries or should you use different colours? Explain using either Figure 1.24 or 1.25.



6. When might you use the left-side of Figure 1.27 to show the law school data? When might you use the right-side of Figure 1.27 to show the law school data?



7. Summary: What are two takeaways from Sections 1.3-1.7?


8. What is one question that you have about the reading?
